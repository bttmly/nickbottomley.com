        <h3 class="entry__minor-title">JavaScript Development</h3>
        <p class="entry__description">I have extensive JavaScript experience including exposure to MVC frameworks, design patterns, asynchronous design, CoffeeScript, jQuery, and server-side programming with Node.js. I love the language and stay extremely current with new developments and practices in the JS community.</p>

        <h3 class="entry__minor-title">HTML, CSS, & Design</h3>
        <p class="entry__description">I'm a CSS expert; I write modular, maintainable styles with or without preprocessors or frameworks. I've used all major preprocessors (SASS/SCSS, LESS, Stylus), as well as frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation. Familiar with principles of OOCSS and the BEM naming syntax. Strong eye for digital visual design. Responsive, mobile-first design is always a top priority. I have a thorough understanding of semantic HTML as well as experience with a variety of HTML templating languages and frameworks.</p>

        <p class="entry__description">I am a strong writer and editor, and love working with words. While working with the Berkeley Science & Math Initiative, I coordinated rewriting the entire content of the Cal Teach website, which included writing the majority of the content as well as editing work from colleagues. I have written periodic program reports to sponsoring agencies and have also edited and revised research and program proposals.</p>

          Tok3n provides multi-factor authentication as a service to application developers. My work has primarily focused on prototyping, designing, and coding the user signup and onboarding experience, as well as producing modular components that help clients integrate the service with their applications. I've been primarily working with JavaScript and SASS with an eye towards abstracting common patterns for better reusability.
