  description:   I'm currently upgrading and redesigning a fantasy football <a href="http://nickb1080.github.io/nfl-plotter/">tool</a> I built last year. This project allows you to examine trends by player and position to help determine strategy in fantasy football drafts.

- name: Controls.js
  description:   Getting data out of input elements, and listening for changes, should be easier. Controls.js is a small helper library written in CoffeeScript with no dependencies that aims to be an intuitive solution for dealing with user input. Still very much a work in progress.

- name: NBA Shot Chart Mapping
  description:   Inspired by <a href="http://grantland.com/contributors/kirk-goldsberry/">Kirk Goldsberry's</a> shot charts on Grantland, I'm working on a little client web app based on the NBA's API that will allow users to visualize player's spatial shooting tendencies. Comparative mapping is in progress.
